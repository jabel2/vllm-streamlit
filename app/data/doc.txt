SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Commission is adopting amendments to 17 CFR
275.203A-2(e) (“rule 203A-2(e)” or “Internet Adviser Exemption”) under the Investment

amendments to 17 CFR 279.1 (“Form ADV”) under the Advisers Act.1
I. Introduction
A. Overview
We are adopting amendments to rule 203A-2(e) under the Advisers Act. The Internet
Adviser Exemption provides an exemption from the prohibition on registration with the
Commission that may otherwise affect certain advisers seeking to register with us. The
amendments are designed to modernize the Internet Adviser Exemption’s conditions to account
for the evolution in technology and the investment advisory industry since the adoption of the
rule over 20 years ago. Specifically, the amendments will require an internet investment adviser
to provide investment advice to all of its clients exclusively through an “operational” interactive
website at all times during which it relies on the Internet Adviser Exemption. The amendments
also will eliminate the de minimis exception in the current rule that permits internet investment
advisers to have fewer than 15 non-internet clients in the preceding 12-month period. In addition,
we are adopting amendments to Form ADV to conform certain instructions and definitions to the
amended Internet Adviser Exemption and to require additional representations regarding an
internet investment adviser’s reliance on the rule.
In July 2023, the Commission proposed amendments to the Internet Adviser Exemption
with certain corresponding amendments to Form ADV.2 The Commission received eight
comments on the proposed amendments.3 Most commenters expressed broad support for the
